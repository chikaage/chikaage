  _i didnt expect to have this, my day started out very great. chajju offered to go ride the bus to campus today, so i dont have to worry running late. bleve cooked breakfast and cleaned the house before going to work. venn seemed so happy after i cooked him eggs and bacons. work was nice, my paperwork is finally done however the printer was broken so its under maintenance. dinner was delicious and i went to bed with a pleased appetite._
